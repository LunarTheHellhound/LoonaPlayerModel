### Note: We modified the model from NSFW to a SFW with added support for Lethal Company. Removing any ability to pull the model for personal use. We ask that you go and support the original model through the link above. As we don't take any credit for the model, we just imported her into Lethal Company.

- The image above is what you will get from ripping it from our .dll. You won't have any of the model's features other than combined mesh and base bones. Like stated above, we removed any form of NSFW from the model. From the textures to the vertices. If you rip the model, you are getting a heavily watered down version of the model.
- The image below is what you get if you pay for the model! You will get everything from all of the rigs, all the way down to the NSFW. Just another reason to buy the model and not to rip it from the mod. If you do buy the model because of this mod, thank you. As it means a lot to us (ProjectBuddies) and even more to AeridicCore.
